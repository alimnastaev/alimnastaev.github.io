Code Louisville Fall 2017 Project.

This is my Code Louisville Fall 2017 graduation project. The goal was to create a fully responsive website using the most popular front-end languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, etc.

The project is my personal artistic website to present my music online.

The website was build using “mobile first” approach. I did not use any frameworks (Bootstrap is the most popular) for that matter. Responsiveness was achieved by creating custom media queries at the certain breakpoints.

I created a sticky navigation bar with lines of CSS.

Navigation is horizontal and sticky across all the media devices and/or browser sizes or screen resolutions.

I’ve implemented a “humburger” menu using CSS only for visitors who use smaller screens. It becomes appear only after a certain point when braking down a browser page and on mobile devices. Drop-down menu appears when the “humburger” icon is clicked on.

All the active tabs are highlighted (on mobile devices as well) to help visitors easily navigate through the site.

There are “call to action” buttons on CONTACT PAGE. The purpose is to separate all the incoming emails/messages by a subject. All the buttons are had been disabled until custom email addresses will be created.

“Image Carousel” on the TITLE PAGE was created without plugins with a custom jQuery code and it is fully responsive.  

MEDIA PAGE is an image gallery viewable as thumbnails or via a Lightbox. Later, I will use the same concept for the all video material.  

The website footer contains copyright information along with the active social platform icons.

Favourite icon or “favicon”. Check out this little picture along with the site’s name in browser tabs.  (Most people’s bookmarks/favorites list is a very cluttered place. Having yours stand out with a nice graphical reminder of your site beside it is a good way to get their attention again).

Each page has the exact same design, including footer, just the content itself is different.
